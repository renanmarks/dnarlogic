# DNArLogic

This is a R package developed to design and simulate digital logic circuits
implemented in formal Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) and DNA-based reaction
networks using Strand Displacement reactions.

This package uses [DNAr](https://git.nanocomp.dcc.ufmg.br/dnacomputing/dnar).

## How to Install It

Firstly, using the R console, install the `devtools` package:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

After that, just install the `DNAr` package:

```R
